The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, located in the southern part of Guangdong Province in China, is one
of the most rapidly developing regions in the world. The evolution of local and regional sea-breeze circulation (SBC) is believed to be responsible for forming meteorological conditions for high air-pollution
episodes in the PRD. To understand better the impacts of urbanization and its associated urban heat island
(UHI) on the local- and regional-scale atmospheric circulations over PRD, a number of high-resolution
numerical experiments, with different approaches to treat the land surface and urban processes, have been
conducted using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5). The results show that an accurate urban land-use dataset and a proper
urban land-use parameterization are critical for the mesoscale model to capture the major features of the
observed UHI effect and land–sea-breeze circulations in the PRD. Stronger UHI in the PRD increases the
differential temperature gradient between urbanized areas and nearby ocean surface and hence enhances
the mesoscale SBC. The SBC front consequently penetrates farther inland to overcome the prevailing
easterly flow in the western part of inland Hong Kong. Additional sensitivity studies indicate that further
industrial development and urbanization will strengthen the daytime SBC as well as increase the air
temperature in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere.
