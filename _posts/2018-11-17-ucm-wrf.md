## Abstract
For an increasing number of applications, mesoscale modelling systems now aim to better represent urban areas. The complexity of processes resolved by **urban parametrization schemes** varies with the application. The concept of fitness-forpurpose is therefore critical for both the choice of parametrizations and the way in which the scheme should be evaluated. A systematic and objective model response analysis procedure (Multiobjective Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (MOSCEM) algorithm) is used to assess the fitness of the single-layer **urban canopy parametrization** implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The scheme is evaluated regarding its ability to simulate observed **surface energy fluxes and the sensitivity** to input parameters. Recent amendments are described, focussing on features which improve its applicability to numerical weather prediction, such as a reduced and physically more meaningful list of input parameters. The study shows a high sensitivity of the scheme to parameters characterizing **roof properties** in contrast to a low response to **road-related ones**. Problems in partitioning of energy between **turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes** are also emphasized. Some initial guidelines to prioritize efforts to obtain urban **land-cover class characteristics** in WRF are provided.
