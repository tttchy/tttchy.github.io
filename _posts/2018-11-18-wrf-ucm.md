## ABSTRACT:
>To bridge the gaps between traditional mesoscale modelling and microscale modelling, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in collaboration with other agencies and research groups, has developed an integrated urban modelling system coupled to the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model as a community tool to address urban environmental issues. **The core of this WRF/urban modelling system consists of the following: (1) three methods with different degrees of freedom to parameterize urban surface processes, ranging from a simple bulk parameterization to a sophisticated multi-layer urban canopy model with an indoor–outdoor exchange sub-model that directly interacts with the atmospheric boundary layer, (2) coupling to fine-scale computational fluid dynamic Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and Large-Eddy simulation models for transport and dispersion (T&D) applications, (3) procedures to incorporate highresolution urban land use, building morphology, and anthropogenic heating data using the National Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (NUDAPT), and (4) an urbanized high-resolution land data assimilation system.** This paper provides an overview of this modelling system; addresses the daunting challenges of initializing the coupled WRF/urban model and of specifying the potentially vast number of parameters required to execute the WRF/urban model; explores the model sensitivity to these urban parameters; and evaluates the ability of WRF/urban to capture urban heat islands, complex boundary-layer structures aloft, and urban plume T&D for several major metropolitan regions. Recent applications of this modelling system illustrate its promising utility, as a regional climate-modelling tool, to investigate impacts of future urbanization on regional meteorological conditions and on air quality under future climate change scenarios.

In the section 2, we describe the integrated WRF/urban modelling system. We address the issue of initializing the state variables required to run WRF/urban inSection 3 and the issue of specifying urban parameters and model sensitivity to these parameters in Section 4.Section 5 gives examples of model evaluation and of applying the WRF/urban model to various urbanization problems, and this is followed by a summary in Section 6.

## 2.Description of the integrated WRF/urban modelling system
路面模式：Noah LSM 提供地表感热和潜热通量，地表温度，作为耦合大气模式的下边界条件。It is based on a diurnally varying Penman potential evaporation approach, a multi-layer soil model, a modestly complex canopy resistance parameterization, surface hydrology, and frozen ground physics.Prognostic variables in Noah include liquid water, ice, and temperature in the soil layers; water stored in the vegetation canopy; and snow water equivalent stored on the ground.


Here, we mainly focus the urban modelling efforts on coupling different urban canopy models (UCMs) with Noah in WRF. Such coupling is through the parameter urban percentage (or urban fraction, Furb) that represents the proportion of impervious surfaces in the WRF subgrid scale. For a given WRF grid cell, the Noah model calculates surface fluxes and temperature for vegetated urban areas (trees, parks, etc.) and the UCM provides the fluxes for anthropogenic surfaces. The total gridscale sensible heat flux, for example, can be estimated as follows:
      **QH = Fveg × QHveg + Furb × QHurb (1)**
where QH is the total sensible heat flux from the surface to the WRF model lowest atmospheric layer, Fveg is the fractional coverage of natural surfaces, such as grassland, shrubs, crops, and trees in cities, Furb is the fractional coverage of impervious surfaces, such as buildings, roads, and railways. QHveg is the sensible heat flux from Noah for natural surfaces, and QHurb is the sensible heat flux from the UCM for artificial surfaces. Grid-integrated latent heat flux, upward long wave radiation flux, albedo, and emissivity are estimated in the same way. Surface skin temperature is calculated as the averaged value of the artificial and natural surface temperature values, and is subsequently weighted by their areal coverage.
